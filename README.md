## Course description

Nowadays, most web developers are using "MVC" concepts and frameworks to organize the JavaScript that powers their website and better separate the presentation from the data.

In this evening workshop, we'll give an overview of MVC frameworks and spend most of our time actually getting our hands dirty using MVC concepts. We'll give an overview of popular frameworks, like Backbone and Angular, but we will not focus on any framework in particular. You'll write your own tiny Model/View framework and learn about other MV* frameworks in JavaScript.

*This is intended to be a follow-up workshop for JS101, JS201, JS202, and JS204. See the prerequisites question for additional details.*
