<h2>Routing</h2>

<p>Frameworks that use routes allow you to use the back button in browsers.</p>

<p>Seems simple, doesn't it? But with all of that clicking around on one single page, you can't store anything in browser history, which means you can't go back without losing everything.</p>

<p>Not all frameworks use routing.</p>
