<h2>MVC Features</h2>

<p>JavaScript MVC frameworks (usually) share 3 primary features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Two-way Binding between HTML and a client-side JavaScript object model
View Templates</li>
  <li>Data Storage (local or through a web server to a database)</li>
  <li>URL Routing (keeping the back button working and search engines happy)</li>
</ul>
