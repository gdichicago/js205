<h2>MVVM</h2>

<p>Three components: Model, View, ViewModel.</p>

<p><strong>ViewModels</strong> send messages between the View and the Model - it is a mediator or converter. It changes Model info into View info, passes commands from the View into the Model, and exposes public properties, commands, and abstractions.</p>

<p>Examples: <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">KnockoutJS</a></p>
