<h2>Two-way data binding</h2>

<p>Most frameworks have two-way data binding. With two-way data binding, you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Update the HTML inputs, which will update your JavaScript object</li>
  <li>Update the JavaScript object, which will update every HTML attribute bound to it</li>
</ul>

<p>Neat, huh?</p>
