<h2>Data binding</h2>

<p>Data binding is one of the most popular features of JavaScript MVC frameworks. How it works:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Change data in your HTML inputs</li>
  <li>The JavaScript object bound to the input is <em>immediately</em> updated</li>
  <li>Any other elements that are bound to that property update automatically</li>
</ul>
