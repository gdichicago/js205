<p>Yeah, I know. That's a lot. But! We can break that into two smaller, nested views:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>BookView</code></li>
  <li><code>BookShelfView</code></li>
</ul>

<br><br>
<p>Our <code>BookShelfView</code> can be comprised of a bunch of little <code>BookView</code>s. So what does that look like?</p>
